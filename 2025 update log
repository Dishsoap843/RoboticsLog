Common issues when getting new software from year to year typically come from certain parts being 2025 and certain parts not being updated yet

1. Make sure to install new game tools/WPILib
2. Install new dependencies, kauailabs is now under studica which was giving us problems.
3. Adjust code to meet the syntax of new dependencies
3. Update hardware such as power brick and motor controllers, to do this plug into the power brick -> go to the rev hardware client -> Update everything that comes up.
4. Update Limelight/set team number for limelight

1. Open up Apache NetBeans and open "RoboticsLog.java" (should already be open)
2. Click run and follow the prompts given in the console (Create/move to a new file) -> (Create file) -> (Type one line at a time with -1 to exit)
3. Make sure NOT TO CHANGE ANY CODE (Unless you know what your doing or making it auto push to github which is the bane of my existence)
4. Open up Git Bash and paste this line into the console (Removing quotes around it): "cd Desktop/ ; cd Robotics\ Log ; git push"
5. Check github and watch your amazing documentation be logged!

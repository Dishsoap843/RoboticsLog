RoboRIO is not connecting to drive station(Communications isn't green and "RoboRIO2" is red) (error 44002)

Could be a an issue with the hardware of the RoboRIO itself, could be a firewall issue on the schools computer so we are trying it on someones home computer(Although data is being sent and received with ping)

The Drive Station IS connected to the Radio through wifi.

We tried several things:

1. Connecting the RoboRIO to the computer manually works and allows for communication

2. We initially pinged the roboRIO wirelessly from the computer and received 0 packets, we switched out the radio to the current one and now when pinging recieve 2-4 packets each time. This still did not fix the communications error however.

3. We tried using different wires that connected the radio to the roboRIO but it didn't change anything.

4. We tried using an old roboRIO 1 and it DID work and allowed for wireless communications making us think it was an issue with the roboRIO(Currently we have the latest RoboRIO 2.0 connected)

5. After that we tried using an SD card with the 2022 flash connected to the roboRIO but it didn't work.

6. Tried reinstalling the game tools and reflashing the latest software to the SD using Balena Etcher.



Lights: (https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/hardware/hardware-basics/status-lights-ref.html)

Power working(Not a power issue for radio or roboRIO)

Status blinks for a bit when turned on then goes off

Comms stays red when it has a manual connection but with wireless

Radio dosen't light up

Ethernet from radio gives power to roboRIO(Lights up at port)
